# Matrix 

# 1. Create a matrix object 'A' with 4 rows and 3 columns, filled with numbers 1...12 by rows.
# i.e. A[1,1] should be 1, A[1,2] should be 2, and A[1,3] should be 3.

# 2. Create a matrix object 'B' with 3 rows and 4 columns, filled with numbers 1,3,5,7,9,...23 by columns.
# i.e. B[1,1] = 1, B[2,1] = 3, B[3,1] = 5, B[1,2] = 7 ...

# 3. What is the 3rd row, 3rd column element of the matrix B?

# 4. Compute a matrix multiplication of A times B and assign the result to a matrix object 'D'

# 5. Compute a matrix multiplication of D and the transpose of D 


## Random variable   

# 1. Draw a sample of size 10 from a normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 4. 

# 2. Plot a histogram using the sample you draw in Q2. 

# 3 Repeat Q1 and Q2 for different sample sizes: 100, 1000, and 10000. What do you notice? 


# 5. Draw a sample of size 10000 from a uniform distribution with the minimum value being 5 and the maximum value being 10. 
#    Plot a histogram using the sample.
