# What are file paths?
# (written by Fabricio Vasselai)

Nowadays, many computer users are not used to having to think about where in their computer their
files are stored. Which means, many users never had to deal with or have heard of what is called
"file paths". They simply search for a file name and the computer finds it for them.

However, it is imperative that we all know how to identify file paths, because when we are using
functions in R like the read.csv function, you have to infor such function where exactly in your
computer a file is located. Which means, you have to know the file path.

Let me give definitions first. The path of a given file is just a convenient way of representing
where exactly in your hard drive such file is stored. Usually, such address is represented with
folders, subfolders and then file name.

# Windows and MacOS/Linux examples

Let me give examples.

#### Windows ####

In Windows, suppose a photo that you have stored has file path "C:/User/MyPictures/photo_in_cancun.jpg".
This means that the sweet picture you took last time you went to Cancun, and which you stored in a file
named "photo_in_cancun.jpg", can be found in the hard drive partition that Windows calls "C:", within
"C:"'s a folder called "MyPictures", but which in its turn is inside a folder called "User" (which means
we say that "MyPicture" is a subfolder of folder "User"). Similarly, suppose you have a CSV file called
"mydata.csv" stored in the hard drive partition "D" (Windows uses single uppercase letters to identify
hard drive partitions), folder "Umich" and subfolder "class514". Then, the file path of "mydata.csv"
would be "D:/Umich/class514/mydata.csv".

Why is that important? Well, because file path is what you give as input in the first argument of the R
function read.csv. For instance:
loaded.data <- read.csv("D:/Umich/class514/mydata.csv")

Obs: don't forget that the function read.csv, as many functions, returns an object. In this case, it returns
an object of type data.frame that contains all the information read from the "mydata.csv" file. But you have
to inform R the name of an object where you want to store such output. In the example above, the read.csv
function is assigning to object "loaded.data" all the information read from "mydata.csv".

#### MacOS/Linux #### 

In Mac OS, suppose a photo that you have stored has file path "~/Desktop/MyPictures/photo_in_cancun.jpg".
This means that the sweet picture you took last time you went to Cancun, and which you stored in a file
named "photo_in_cancun.jpg", can be found in the main hard drive you are currently using, within a folder
called "MyPictures", but which in its turn is inside a folder called "User" (which means we say that
"MyPicture" is a subfolder of folder "User").  Similarly, suppose you have a CSV file called "mydata.csv"
stored in the main hard drive you are currently using, inside folder "Umich" and subfolder "class514".
Then, the file path of "mydata.csv" would be "~/Umich/class514/mydata.csv".

Why is that important? Well, because file path is what you give as input in the first argument of the R
function read.csv. For instance:
loaded.data <- read.csv("~/Umich/class514/mydata.csv")

Obs: don't forget that the function read.csv, as many functions, returns an object. In this case, it returns
an object of type data.frame that contains all the information read from the "mydata.csv" file. But you have
to inform R the name of an object where you want to store such output. In the example above, the read.csv
function is assigning to object "loaded.data" all the information read from "mydata.csv".
